%%% Initialization
k_max = 5; % maximum number of iterations
k = 1; % current iteration number
B = 12; % number of spatial blocks
T = 24*60*2; % number of time step 
R = 5; % number of requests
P = zeros(1,R); % number of generated path per request
eps_tolerance = 1e-10; % tolerance level for ending the bundle phase
diff = -eps_tolerance;

%%% Parameters to store the iteration results
mu = zeros(B,T,k_max+1); %mu(:,:,1) = rand(B,T);% prices initially random
Phi = zeros(R,k_max); % dual objective function
g = zeros(B,T,R,k_max); % sub-gradient of the dual obj function
lambda = zeros(R,k_max); % multiplier for the convex combinations of paths
Path = zeros(R,k_max); % store the path which was chosen for a request at certain iteration

%%% Global param
global ids
global requests
global network
global ordering

%%% Read the network data (OBS. specify the absolute path with "/")
[ids, requests, network, ordering, P] = MexReadData('C:/Users/abde/Desktop/PhD/Projects/[PO] Langrangean relaxation/data');

%%% Dual iteration

    %%% Solve the shortes path (C++)
    [Phi(:,k), g(:,:,:,k), Path(:,k)] = MexShortestPathSeq(ids, requests, network, ordering, mu(:,:,k));
    
    %%% Compute the new prices (Matlab)
    [mu(:,:,k+1), lambda(:,1:k), diff] = bundle(mu(:,:,1:k), Phi(:,1:k), g(:,:,:,1:k));
